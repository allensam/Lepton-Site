### Colors

![Colors](/public/images/colors.png)

Colors are variables inside the less file, prefaced with yeezy (e.g. @yeezyWhite, @yeezyRed, @yeezyOrange, @yeezyBlue, @yeezyGray). All colors besides white have a dark version named prefaced with yeezyDark. Currently using only the white, gray, and red colors. The others are only there if we need to use them (we want to avoid this, keep it simple and professional).
