  Welcome to the Angular tutorial! This tutorial will teach you how to use
  AngularJS. AngularJS is a Javascript framework. If you haven't learned the
  basics of Javascript I'd HIGHLY recommend learning a bit of Javascript. For
  starters, Angular is a platform that binds the Javascript to the HTML and the
  HTML to the Javascript. This allows you to call Javascript functions from
  anywhere in the code on any sort of event, or modify the HTML with Javascript.
  We will cover that later but for now, let's dive right in!<br>
  <div ng-show="showNewDiv">
    Wow isn't that cool :D
  </div>
  <button ng-click="runCode('example_of_angular')">Change statement to true and click here!</button>
  <br>
  {{example_of_angular}}
  <div class="all-editors-class" id="example_of_angular">$scope.showNewDiv = false;</div>

  what you saw was one of the main things angular wants to acomplish the binding
  of data. What does this mean? Basically Angular wants important data to be
  able to be accessed from both the javascript and html.

  Now it's time to dive right in on how to creat an angular app!
  <div class="tab-wrap">
    <div class="tab" data-tab-reference="tab_1">Tab 1</div>
    <div class="tab" data-tab-reference="tab_2">Tab 2</div>
    <br>
    <div class="tab-section active" data-tab-id="tab_1">
        <div class="all-editors-class" data-tab-name="section-one" id="testjst">function () {}</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-section" data-tab-id="tab_2">
      <div class="all-editors-class" data-tab-name="section-two" id="testhtml"></div>
    </div>

  </div>



  <!-- loads javascript from the vendor file  -->
  <!-- ONLY LOAD ON THIS PAGE OR OTHER JAVAVSCRIPT TUTORIALS -->
  <!-- this also includes the ace editor -->
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'compile-routes/super-compile-route', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'compile-routes/angular-compile-route', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
