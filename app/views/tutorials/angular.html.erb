  Welecome to the angular tutorial! this tutorial will teach you how to use AngularJS
  AngularJS is a Javascript framework so if you haven't learned the basics of javascript I'd reccommend doing that now.
  To get started Angular is basicaly a platform that binds the javascript to the HTML and the HTML to the javascript
  what this does is basically allow you to call javascript functions from anywhere in the code on any sort of event or modify
  the html with javascript. Let's get deaper into the explaination later and jump right into!<br>
  <div ng-show="showNewDiv">
    Wow isn't that cool :D
  </div>
  <button ng-click="runCode()">Change statement to true and click here!</button><br>

  <div class="all-editors-class" id="example_of_angular">$scope.showNewDiv = false;</div>
  <div>
    <input class="bar" type="range" value="50" ng-model="rangeslider"/>
    <span class="highlight"></span>
  </div>
  <!-- loads javascript from the vendor file  -->
  <!-- ONLY LOAD ON THIS PAGE OR OTHER JAVAVSCRIPT TUTORIALS -->
  <!-- this also includes the ace editor -->
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'compile-routes/super-compile-route', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'compile-routes/angular-compile-route', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
