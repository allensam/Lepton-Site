    <p> Welcome to the HTML tutorial! HTML is not a programming language but "markers"
      that tell the browser to do something for each specific spot. This is an html example;
      the "style" tag at the end marks some where some CSS goes. All it does is add skin to
      HTML and make it look pretty.</p>
    </p>
    <span ng-bind-html="htmlExample"></span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- editor that binds html to page -->
    <div class="bind-html" id="htmlExample" onkeyup="htmlKeyUpEventListener(this);">
    </div>

    <p> What you are seen here is basically a bracket followed by div which in HTML
      you think it as a literal rectangle. It automatically conforms to the content size
      but one can make it bigger if they'd like.
    </p>
    <p> Since this tutorial is mostly about memorizing what certain things do this will go fast
      show many different tags in a short period of time. Do not freak out if it moves too fast;
      take your time and test things out. It's okay if you don't remember tags, because in the future you can
      look them up. There will be more tags than this tutorial covers, but that's because some tags
      aren't used since styling becomes more customized and true to yourself. However it is likely
      that you will see these other tags and that's okay!
    </p>
    <p> Here comes the big load of information. Some of these things inside the tag you learn in different
      tutorials.
